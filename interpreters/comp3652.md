Language Processors
===================

Phases of Interpretation (and Compilation)
------------------------------------------
1. Input is tokenized by a Scanner.
    A program, called the Scanner (also called a lexer or a tokenizer)
    reads over the input and turns the
    characters in it into tokens.
    A token is one or more characters that is significant as a group.
    The process of forming tokens from an input stream of characters is
    called tokenization.
    The end result of the tokenization process is a token stream.

2. The token stream is parsed by a Parser.
    A parser takes a token stream and checks it for validity.
    It is at this stage of interpretation that syntactic errors
    (invalid combinations of tokens) are found.
    The parser simply validates the input, but is able to produce an
    Intermediate Representation (IR) of the program as a side effect.
    An IR is a data structure, usually a tree, such as an Abstract
    Syntax Tree (AST).

3. IR Walking (Interpreting)
    The interpreter takes an IR and walks it, producing a value.
    For example, the expression

      `x = 5 + 10`

    would evaluate to `15` when interpreted.
    It is important to note that the value can be anything.

3a. Translation and Code Generation
    When code is compiled, it goes through the lexing and parsing
    stages, but instead of being evaluated immediately, it is
    translated to another representation, usually Object Code,
    or another language.


Syntax vs Semantics
-------------------
Syntax refers to the structure of valid tokens in a language,
whereas sematics refers to the meaning of different tokens.
Syntactical processing is done in the Parser, and Semantic processing
is done by the interpreter or code generator, in interpretation and
compilation respectively.

Tombstone Diagrams
------------------
Tombstone diagrams consist of a set of "puzzle pieces" representing language
processors and programs.
They are used to illustrate and reason about transformations from a source
language, A, into a target language, B, realized in an implementation
language, L.

Tombstone diagrams must be composed using the following rules:

1. Juxtaposed sections must have matching languages.
1. Every process respresented must have a machine at its base.

Bootstrapping a Compiler
------------------------
Bootstrapping a compiler is the process of writing a compiler in the language
it is meant to compile.
Bootstrapping provides a consistency check for the compiler, as it should be
able to produce its own object code (self-compilation consistency check).
This, however, requires a compiler for the language, a chicken or egg problem.
If no high level languages area available for the target platform, creating
the initial compiler requires the following steps:

1. Define a subset of the language (kernel) that is equally powerful.
1. Write a compiler for the kernel language in assembly.
1. Write a compiler for the full language in the kernel language.
1. Rewrite the compiler for the full language using itself.

When a compiler is written in the language it compiles, it is said to be
self hosted.

Virtual Machines
----------------
A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a real computer.
It may be based on specifications of a hypothetical computer, or made to
emulate a real computer.
Examples of VMs include the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the Python
Interpreter.

Regular Expressions
-------------------
### Definitions
Alphabet - A set of symbols
String - A string over an alphabet, Σ, is a sequence of length 0 or more of
symbols in Σ.

### Notation
Σ* = The set of all strings over Σ
ε = The empty string

A regular expression over an alphabet Σ, is a string over the set
Σ v {|, (, ), *} that represent a set of strings over Σ.
Regular expressions represent patterns.

There are 6 possible forms:

1. ![Empty set](http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/a/f/7affadd6f994df906e695d1f19a3ff73.png) - The empty set.
1. ε - {""}
1. α - α where α ∈ Σ = {α}.
1. (R1)(R2) - The set of strings obtained by concatenating a string
              represented by R1 and those represented by R2.
1. (R1)|(R2) - The union of the strings represented by R1 and R2.
1. (R1)* - The set of strings that can be obtained by concatenating 0 or more
           strings represented by R1.
