Notes of a 3rd Year
=======================

What is this?
-------------
These are my notes from my 3rd year classes at UWI.
The notes are written in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), so
I can compile them into a PDF near exam time using
[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) or some similar tool.
They're on github so everyone can get and even contribute to them.
