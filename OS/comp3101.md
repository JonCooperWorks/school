Operating Systems
=================

Definition
----------
An Operating System is a piece of software designed to abstract away the
complexity of hardware components from userspace applications.
For example, if a program requests a file to be printed, instead of having
to handle all aspects of print job queueing itself, it can simply use an
API provided by the Operating System to print the file.
